## About This Site

Welcome to my personal website. This is a space where I share my thoughts on technology, projects I'm working on, and anything else I find interesting.

### The Technology

This site is built with **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** and uses the custom, ultra-lightweight "squishy" theme. The goal was to create a site that is incredibly fast, accessible, and easy to maintain, with a total page weight of under 15KB. ðŸš€

### Contact

You can find me on **[GitHub](https://github.com/rigred)** or reach out via email.
